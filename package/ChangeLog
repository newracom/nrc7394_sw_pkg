Change summary for version 1.2:

  New features
    * Multi-STA rate control (RC) for AP: provide individual RC for each STA
    * RSSI-based rate control (RC) for STA
      o cli_app set rc_pf <1|2> (This should be done before the Wi-Fi connection.)
        1: original RC (default)
        2: RSSI based RC

  Bugfix
    * Throughput degradation by fragmented A-MPDU MAC frame
    * NDP CTS compliance for RTS with response indication (RI) 1 on AP
    * Not to send WIM message when target is in deep sleep
    * Delayed ping issue triggerd by powering off the STA
    * Long beacon only duty cycle setting issue
    * Null pointer dereference triggerd by a keep alive frame after the disassociation
    * Bandwidth misconfiguration in the MCS10 frame triggered by fragmentation cancellation under strong RSSI
    * Kernel panic triggerd by the inaccessable vif address when hostapd is disabled in 4-address (bridge) mode
    * Fail to enable hybrid security on the relay node
    * Occasional modem recovery operation on the bridged relay node
    * Prohibit scan operations during deep sleep mode
    * Flush the mac80211 TX queue in Kernel 4.x. 
      (The mac80211 TX queue scheduling function is not supported in Kernel 4.x. 
       Therefore, flush the mac80211 TX queue and clean the NRC TX queue.)
    * Set an invalid AID in the AID response element when sending an association response

  Changes
    * Update cli_app commands: refer to UG-7394-007-Commnad line application document
    * Coverage enhancement by using 1/2MHz MCS0 frame on 2/4MHz channels
    * 1/2MHz STA support at 4MHz AP
    * DTS update for SPI interface: enable spidev0.1
    * Enhance auto guard interval (GI) with peer node's GI capability check
    * Add auto RX gain control
    * Increase buffer pool and credit number of AC_BE for flow control between host and target 
      (from 40 to 80 and it's not configurable anymore via the module parameter)
    * WDT reset recovery support on MAP
    * Enhance to discard frames with corrupted host interface header
    * Check traveling pilot support field of S1G capabilities element
    * Enhance to conduct TRX operation during the background scanning
    * Improve routing at the low RSSI on the mesh node
    * Recover 'rxskb' error through the reset HSPI controller
    * Mesh inactivity timer off by default
    * China channel update: 749.0MHz ~ 757.0MHz
    * Multi-STA support change: up to 484 STAs (due to the increased memory usage of multi-STA RC)
    * PS Pretend mode to maintain network performance and minimize the impact of non-responsive STAs

  Known Issues
    * In multi-hop mesh network, DHCP may experience delays or failures. 
      It is recommended to use static IP addresses for networks with more than three hops.
    * Using a short guard interval on 1 or 2 MHz channels can lead to degraded performance.
    * The issue of deauthentication frame delivery failure can occur 
      between PMF-enabled NRC7394 and PMF-enabled NRC7292 devices.

Change summary for version 1.1:

  New features
    * GPIO configuration for deep sleep
        o Host mode (Build-time configuration)
          - build-time configuration by editing in nrc-vendor.h
            : TARGET_DEEP_SLEEP_GPIO_DIR
              TARGET_DEEP_SLEEP_GPIO_OUT
              TARGET_DEEP_SLEEP_GPIO_PULLUP
        o Host mode (Run-time configuration)
          - run-time configuration by cli_app
            : cli_app set deepsleep_gpio <dir> <out> <pullup>
    * Support preferred BSS Max Idle period of STA on AP

  Bugfix
    * Unstable power consumption under deep sleep mode
    * Duplicate TIM checking
    * AP's downlink throughput is abnormally high under LBT condition of KR domain
    * AP sends 1/2/4M probe response frame according to bandwidth of probe request from STA
    * Delayed response for 'iw scan' command under the heavy traffic
    * Multicast frame's SN is not sequential when duty cycle is on
    * Kernel panic caused when beacon_bypass_enable of start.py is 1
    * Invalid secondary CCA on JP 2/4MHz channels
    * Occaionsal WDT reset occurs when performing frequent ifconfig up/down operations on AP
    * 1MHz primary channel location compliance issue: device should follow the location of the 1MHz primary channel
    * frame format compliance issue: the same frame format should be used within a single frame sequence
    * RI of RTS compliance issue: legacy CTS frame format was used in open mode AP

  Changes
    * Update cli_app commands: refer to UG-7394-007-Commnad line application document
